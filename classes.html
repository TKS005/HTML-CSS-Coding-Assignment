    <p class="fight_types">Our BJJ, or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, classes will be lead by UFC Featherweight Contender, Bryce Mitchell. Bryce holds the all time 
        record for body twister submissions in all of MMA history (2). He currently holds the most submissions among active UFC featherweights. </p>
    <p class="fight_types"> This class will focus primarily on traditional, or orthodox, submissions such as the "Rear Naked Choke", "Arm Bar",
        and "Knee Bar". Bryce will walk you through every step on how to set up each of these submissions as well as defending these submissions
        if you are to find yourself in such a situation.

<p class="fight_types"> Our Muay Thai classes will be led by current UFC Middleweight champion, Israel Addesanya. Addesanya currently holds the most title defenses in UFC Middleweight history (9).
</p> 
<p class="fight_types"> Our Muay Thai Classes will focus on mostly clinch strikes, such as elbows, knees, and upper cuts when caught in the clinch.
    Working from the clinch is a great way to also work on your take-down defense to avoid submissions.
